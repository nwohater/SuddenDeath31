# 🎲 Sudden Death 31

A fast, high-pressure betting card game where **your bet controls the clock**.

---

## 👥 Players
- 4 players (ideal)
- Works with 3–5

---

## 🃏 Components
- Standard 52-card deck
- Chips (each player starts with **20 chips**)

---

## 🎯 Objective
Win chips by:
- Hitting **31** or **Blitz**, or
- Having the **best hand** when the round ends

The game ends when:
- A player runs out of chips, or
- A fixed number of hands is completed

The player with the **most chips** wins.

---

## 🧩 Setup
1. Shuffle the deck
2. Deal **3 cards** to each player
3. Place remaining cards face-down as the draw pile
4. Start with an empty discard pile
5. Choose an opener (rotates clockwise each hand)

---

## 💰 Opening Bet (Sets the Clock)
The opener must place a bet:

- Minimum bet: **1 chip**
- Maximum bet: **equal to the smallest chip stack at the table**

All players ante **exactly that amount** into the pot.

### Bet → Total Turns
| Bet | Total Turns |
|----|------------|
| 1 | 5 turns |
| 2 | 4 turns |
| 3 | 3 turns |
| 4 | 2 turns |
| 5 or more | 1 turn |

> Higher bets mean **fewer turns** for everyone.

There is **no folding, no raising, and no knocking**.

---

## 🔁 Turn Play (Forced Play)
Starting with the player to the opener’s left and continuing clockwise:

On your turn, you **must** do one of the following:
- Draw **1 card** from the deck, then discard **1 card**, or
- Swap **1 card** from your hand with the **top card of the discard pile**

Passing is **not allowed**.

Play continues until:
- An instant win occurs, or
- The turn limit is reached

---

## 💥 Instant Win Conditions
At **any time**, if a player reveals:
- **31** (three cards of the same suit totaling 31), or
- **Blitz** (three cards of the same rank)

➡️ That player immediately wins the entire pot  
➡️ The round ends instantly

---

## 🏁 End-of-Round Showdown
If no instant win occurs:

1. All players reveal their hands
2. Each player scores their **highest single-suit total**
3. The highest total wins the pot

---

## ⚖️ Tie-Breakers
If players are tied on suit total:

1. Highest card in the scoring suit
2. If still tied → second highest card
3. If still tied → third highest card
4. If still tied → split the pot evenly

### Odd Chip Rule
If the pot cannot be split evenly:
- The **extra chip** goes to the player **closest clockwise to the opener**

---

## 💥 Sudden Death Mode
When **all players** have **2 chips or fewer**:

- All opening bets are **forced to 1**
- Each round lasts **5 turns**
- The **first completed round** immediately ends the game

Winner:
- Player who wins that round

---

## 🏆 Winning the Game
The game ends when:
- A player runs out of chips, or

The player with the **most chips** is the winner.
